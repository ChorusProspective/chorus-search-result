# chorus-search-result

The file data.json contains a graph JSON output from a Chorus product. Graph nodes in data.json are stored under the "entities" key, with links stored under the "links" key, and both entities and links can have their own properties.

Your task is to write a web application using font-end technologies to render a UI (e.g. Vue, React) that allows the user to select/upload a file (in this case data.json) and to display a visual representation using a library such as Cytoscape.js to view the uploaded graph data. 

It is also recommended to include instructions on how to run your solution.
