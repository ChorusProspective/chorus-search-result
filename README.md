# chorus-search-result

The file data.json contains a graph JSON output from a Chorus product. Graph nodes in data.json are stored under the "entities" key, with links stored under the "links" key, and both entities and links can have their own properties.

Your task is to write a web app to display files of the format of data.json, allowing a user to select a file, and have it rendered in a graph view.  

The precise visualisation software or library you use is up to you, and you should determine a sensible scheme for labeling nodes/links, with a user in mind.
